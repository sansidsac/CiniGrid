# Frontend Update Summary - October 5, 2025

## ✅ What Was Done

Updated frontend to match backend API response structures discovered through integration testing.

## 🔍 Root Cause

Backend wraps all responses in nested structure:

```
{ success: true, data: { user: {...}, token: "..." } }
```

Frontend was expecting flat structure:

```
{ success: true, data: { token: "...", id: "..." } }
```

## 🛠️ Files Changed

1. **`web/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`**

   - ✅ Extract `user` and `token` from nested response
   - ✅ Handle both `id` and `_id` fields

2. **`web/src/context/ProjectContext.tsx`**

   - ✅ Extract `projects[]` from nested response
   - ✅ Extract `project` from nested response
   - ✅ Extract `invitations[]` and `count` with fallbacks

3. **`web/src/services/locationService.ts`**
   - ✅ Extract `location` from `response.data.data.location`
   - ✅ Verified `suggestions[]` extraction (already correct)
   - ✅ Verified `locations[]` extraction (already correct)

## 📋 Response Structures (Backend → Frontend)

### Authentication

```
Backend: { data: { user: {...}, token: "..." } }
Extract: user + token → merge into userData
```

### Projects

```
Backend: { data: { projects: [...], count: N } }
Extract: projects array
```

### Locations

```
Backend: { data: { location: {...} } }
Extract: location object
```

### AI Search

```
Backend: { data: { suggestions: [...] } }
Extract: suggestions array
```

## ✅ Testing Status

- [x] Backend integration test passing (5 AI results, projectId preserved)
- [x] Frontend response parsing updated
- [ ] **Next: Manual frontend testing required**

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Start backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Start frontend: `cd web && npm run dev`
3. Test workflows:
   - Login
   - Create project
   - AI search
   - Add location
   - Finalize location
