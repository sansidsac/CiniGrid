   - Implemented JSON recovery from malformed responses
   - Better error messages for debugging

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation if MongoDB unavailable
   - Detailed error logging
   - Recovery mechanisms for common issues

## Next Steps

1. **Start the Full Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test via API**:

   ```bash
   # Get auth token
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"your_user","password":"your_pass"}'

   # Find locations
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/ai-agent/find-locations \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"description":"Modern coffee shop with natural light"}'
   ```

3. **Integrate with Frontend**:
   - Create UI component for location search
