# Contributing to CiniGrid

We love your input! We want to make contributing to CiniGrid as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/feature-name` - for new features
- `bugfix/issue-description` - for bug fixes
- `hotfix/critical-issue` - for critical fixes
- `docs/documentation-update` - for documentation updates

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- MongoDB (local or cloud)
- Git

### Setup Steps
1. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CiniGrid.git`
2. Install backend dependencies: `cd backend && npm install`
3. Install frontend dependencies: `cd ../web && npm install`
4. Set up environment variables (see README.md)
5. Start development servers:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend && npm start
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend  
   cd web && npm run dev
   ```

## Code Style

### General Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new frontend code
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Maintain consistent file structure
- Use proper TypeScript types

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- Use ES6+ features
- Follow RESTful API design
- Implement proper error handling
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Validate all inputs

### Code Formatting
We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting. Run before committing:
```bash
# Frontend
cd web && npm run lint && npm run format

# Backend
cd backend && npm run lint
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend && npm test

# Frontend tests
cd web && npm run test

# Integration tests
cd backend && node test-integration-complete.js
```

### Writing Tests
- Write unit tests for new functions
- Add integration tests for new API endpoints
- Update existing tests when modifying functionality
- Aim for >80% test coverage
